<h1>#Chat App using WebSockets</h1>

<p>
  I'm currently learning WebSockets, so to get some hands-on experience and build confidence, I made this simple real-time chat application.
</p>

<h3>Steps to Start the Application:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fork or clone the project</li>
  <li>Navigate to the <strong>frontend</strong> directory and run:<br />
    <code>npm run dev</code>
  </li>
  <li>Then move to the <strong>backend</strong> directory and run:<br />
    <code>npm run dev</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3> Tech Used:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Frontend – HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
  <li>Backend – Node.js, Express, ws (WebSocket)</li>
</ul>

<h3> Note:</h3>
<p>
  This project was made purely for learning purposes. The UI is minimal as the focus was on understanding how WebSockets work and how to build real-time communication between users.
